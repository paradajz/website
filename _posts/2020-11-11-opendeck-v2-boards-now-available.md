This might be the shortest post I've ever written - but fairly important nonetheless. The OpenDeck v2 boards can now be ordered via [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/paradajz/opendeck-diy-midi-platform/)! As an reminder, OpenDeck v2 boards bring the the following:

- 64 digital inputs for 64 buttons or 32 encoders
- 32 analog inputs which can be used as button inputs as well
- 48 digital outputs for LEDs (with integrated resistors, so no external resistors are required)
- DIN MIDI in and out
- Class-compliant USB MIDI which works on any operating system without any drivers
- Additional UART connector for touchscreens
- Additional I2C connector for small LCD/OLED displays
- Additional SPI connector which is currently unused
- STM32F405 MCU capable of hosting 10 presets

This took longer than expected, but I'm happy that I managed to make them available before the end of this year.
