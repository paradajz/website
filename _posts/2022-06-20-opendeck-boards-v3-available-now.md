The wait is over - new boards are available now on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/paradajz/opendeck-diy-midi-platform-l/)!

To recap, here are the features:

* 128 digital inputs
* 64 digital outputs
* 64 analog inputs
* DIN MIDI
* USB MIDI
* DMX
* Bluetooth on Arduino variant

Price for Black Pill variant is $165, and $175 for Arduino variant. The only difference is Bluetooth support on Arduino variant, and few more presets (since nRF52840 used on Arduino has more flash memory). The boards are being sold without headers, and DIN MIDI connectors are optionally available.
